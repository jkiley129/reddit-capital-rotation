## 🎯 Strategy Overview

This strategy provides a **2-4 week time advantage** over mainstream Wall Street coverage by systematically monitoring Reddit discussions for:

- Mention frequency spikes (3x+ over baseline)
- Cross-subreddit momentum validation
- Sentiment shifts from negative/neutral to positive
- Quality signals (DD posts, insider buying, fundamental catalysts)

## 🎯 Position Sizing & Risk Management

### Allocation Guidelines
- **Tier 1**: 2-5% per position
- **Tier 2**: 1-3% per position
- **Tier 3**: 0.5-1% per position
- **Total Reddit-sourced exposure**: <25% of total portfolio

### Stop-Loss Rules

- Trailing stops once position up 50%+
- Re-evaluate thesis if down >30%

### Exit Signals
1. Mainstream media saturation (CNBC features, Barron's covers)
2. Excessive hype/FOMO language on Reddit
3. Sentiment shift: positive → neutral/negative
4. Insider selling after major run-ups
5. Fundamental deterioration vs. original thesis

## 📈 Momentum Phase Framework

### Phase 1: Early Detection (Weeks 1-2)
- Theme appears in niche subreddits
- Limited mentions (<50/week)
- Few high-quality DD posts
- **Action**: Research watchlist, no position yet

### Phase 2: Building Momentum (Weeks 2-4)
- Cross-subreddit appearance validated
- Increasing mentions (100-500/week)
- Multiple DD posts with analysis
- **Action**: Small exploratory positions (1-2%)

### Phase 3: Mainstream Awareness (Weeks 4-8)
- Major subreddit front page posts
- Financial media starting coverage
- Institutional analysts issuing reports
- **Action**: Evaluate sizing, take partial profits

### Phase 4: Peak Saturation (Week 8+)
- Excessive hype, FOMO behavior
- New retail investors piling in
- Contrarian warnings of overvaluation
- **Action**: Reduce exposure, lock in gains

## 🎓 Investment Philosophy

**"Be early, not late. Be selective, not indiscriminate. Be disciplined, not emotional."**

This strategy exploits the information diffusion lag between:
1. Reddit early adopters (Week 0)
2. Financial Twitter/blogs (Week 1-2)
3. Mainstream financial media (Week 3-4)
4. Institutional research reports (Week 4-8)

By systematically monitoring Reddit with quality filters, we aim to capture **2-4 weeks of alpha** before themes reach peak saturation.
