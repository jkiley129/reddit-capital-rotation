# Reddit Capital Rotation Monitoring Strategy

## Overview
This strategy identifies emerging investment themes from Reddit before they reach mainstream awareness, providing early signals for potential capital rotation opportunities.

## Key Subreddits to Monitor

### Primary Sources (High Signal-to-Noise)
- r/wallstreetbets - Retail sentiment, high-risk plays
- r/stocks - General market discussion
- r/investing - Longer-term perspectives
- r/StockMarket - Broad market trends
- r/options - Derivatives activity signals
- r/Daytrading - Short-term momentum
- r/pennystocks - Speculative early-stage ideas

### Sector-Specific Sources
- r/Biotechplays - Biotech catalysts
- r/EnergyStocks - Energy sector rotation
- r/Semiconductors - Tech hardware trends
- r/CryptoCurrency - Digital asset flows
- r/RenewableEnergy - Green energy trends

### Advanced Signal Sources
- r/SecurityAnalysis - Fundamental analysis
- r/ValueInvesting - Contrarian opportunities
- r/SPACs - Special situations
- r/EarningsThread - Earnings reactions

## Signal Detection Methodology

### 1. Volume Spike Detection
- Track mention frequency over time (7-day, 30-day baselines)
- Identify 3x+ increases in ticker mentions
- Filter for sustained interest (3+ days) vs. one-off pumps

### 2. Sentiment Shift Analysis
- Monitor sentiment changes from neutral/negative to positive
- Track upvote velocity on posts mentioning specific themes/tickers
- Identify "turning point" discussions with high engagement

### 3. Cross-Subreddit Momentum
- Themes appearing across multiple subs indicate broader interest
- Movement from niche subs to mainstream subs signals growing adoption
- Track progression: r/pennystocks → r/stocks → r/investing

### 4. Quality Indicators
- Post author karma and account age (filter bots/shills)
- Comment depth and substantive discussion vs. hype
- Presence of DD (due diligence) posts with research
- Institutional/professional user engagement

### 5. Leading vs. Lagging Indicators
- **Leading**: New technology mentions, regulatory changes, supply chain shifts
- **Coincident**: Earnings surprises, M&A rumors, product launches
- **Lagging**: Media coverage mentions (already mainstream)

## Theme Classification Framework

### Macro Themes
- Interest rate sensitivity shifts
- Inflation hedges gaining traction
- Geographic capital rotation (US → International)
- Risk-on vs. risk-off transitions

### Sector Rotation Themes
- Growth → Value or vice versa
- Large cap → Small cap rotation
- Defensive → Cyclical positioning
- Emerging sector adoption (AI, quantum, biotech)

### Narrative-Driven Themes
- Political/regulatory catalysts
- Technological breakthroughs
- Supply chain disruptions
- Demographic shifts

## Red Flags (False Signals)
- Pump-and-dump patterns (sudden spike then silence)
- Bot activity clusters
- Penny stocks with no fundamental catalyst
- Extremely low market cap (<$100M)
- Companies with regulatory issues
- Heavily promoted by new/low-karma accounts

## Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Early Detection (Weeks 1-2)
- Theme appears in niche subreddits
- Limited mentions (<50/week)
- Few high-quality DD posts emerge
- **Action**: Research watchlist, no position

### Phase 2: Building Momentum (Weeks 2-4)
- Cross-subreddit appearance
- Increasing mention frequency (100-500/week)
- Multiple DD posts with substantive analysis
- **Action**: Small exploratory positions (1-2% portfolio)

### Phase 3: Mainstream Awareness (Weeks 4-8)
- Major subreddit front page appearances
- Mainstream financial media starts covering
- Institutional analysts issue reports
- **Action**: Evaluate position sizing, take partial profits

### Phase 4: Peak Saturation (Week 8+)
- Excessive hype, FOMO behavior
- New retail investors piling in
- Contrarian posts warning of overvaluation
- **Action**: Reduce exposure, lock in gains

## Risk Management
- Max 5% portfolio allocation to any Reddit-sourced theme
- Stop losses at 15-20% for individual positions
- Diversify across 3-5 themes simultaneously
- Regular rebalancing based on momentum shifts

## Data Collection Tools
- Reddit API for historical data
- Pushshift API for comprehensive archives
- Web scraping for real-time monitoring
- Sentiment analysis (NLP/ML models)
- Social listening platforms (optional paid tools)

## Success Metrics
- Time advantage vs. mainstream coverage (target: 2-4 weeks early)
- Win rate on identified themes (target: >50%)
- Risk-adjusted returns vs. benchmark
- False positive rate (target: <30%)
